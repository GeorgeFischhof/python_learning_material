While loops
===========
A while loop repeats code until the condition is met.
Unlike for loops, the number of iterations in it may be unknown.
A while loop always consists of a condition and a block of code.

A while loop is executed if and only if the condition is true,
in contrast to a for loop that always has a finite countable number of steps.
(Even if that countable is zero ;-) )

example:
--------

start = int(input('start: '))    # ask the numbers from the user
finish = int(input('finish: '))
step = int(input('step: '))

number_to_print = start
while number_to_print < finish:
    print(number_to_print)
    number_to_print = number_to_print + step


result:

start: 3
finish: 16
step: 5
3
8
13
