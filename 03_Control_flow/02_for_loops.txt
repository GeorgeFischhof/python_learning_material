For loops
=========

Programs sometimes need to repeat actions.
To repeat actions we can use a for loop

The for loop iterates over an iterable.
Several things can be an "iterable":
- strings
- collections (list, tuple, dictionary, set)
- text files
- result of special functions that creates an iterable

If we want to execute code part in a given number of cycles,
we can use the range function
(this is a built-in special function mentioned above)


range()
-------

range(stop)
range(start, stop)
range(start, stop, step)

- the parameters are integers
- start is defaulted to 0
- stop: numbers will be generated until stop, excluding the value of stop
- step is defaulted to 1


example_1:
----------

for number in range(4):
    print(number)


result_1:

0
1
2
3


example_2:
----------

for even_number in range(2, 11, 2):
    print(even_number)


result_2:

2
4
6
8
10


example_3:
----------

fruits = ('apple', 'banana', 'lemon')  # tuple, iterable
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)


result_3:

apple
banana
lemon
