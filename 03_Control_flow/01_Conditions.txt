Conditions
==========

A program sometimes have to make decisions on certain condition.
And execute different code accordingly.

In Python the if statement is used for conditional execution.


if statement
------------

if expression_is_true:
    code_part_for_true_expression


if ... else statement
---------------------

if expression_is_true:
    code_part_for_true_expression
else:
    code_part_for_false_expression


nested if statements, else if is shorted as elif
------------------------------------------------

if expression_one_is_true:
    code_part_for_true_expression_one
elif expression_two_is_true:
    code_part_for_false_expression_one_and_true_expression_two
else:
    code_part_for_false_expression_one_and_false_expression_two


The boolean expression
----------------------

The expression can be a single boolean variable
(its value is True or False), result of a function call,
or comparator operators can be used, or anything that is
evaluated to True ot False

Comparators:

description                operator

equal to                   ==
not equal to               !=
greater than               >
smaller than               <
greater than or equal to   >=
smaller than or equal to   <=

containing                 in
does not contain           not in

same as                    is
not same as                is not


Conditions may be combined using the keywords: and, or, not


examples
--------

small = 1
big = 10
middle = 5

if small == 1:
    print('small = 1')    # will be printed

if small >= 2:
    print('small >= 2')   # will not be printed
else:
    print('small != 2')   # will be printed

if small < middle < big:  # notation of between
    print('middle is between small and big')

it_is_daytime_now = True
if it_is_daytime_now:
    print('The Sun shines now')
