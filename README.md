To practice Python, you can create a Python developer environment, use the content from
`00_Install_Python_environment` folder

If You have any questions, suggestions, whatever, 
submit an issue at [Issues](https://github.com/GeorgeFischhof/python_learning_material/issues)

The material is updated continuously (when I have time)

If you liked this material you can consider supporting me with a coffee, pizza or beer :D
