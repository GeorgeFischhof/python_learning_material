User functions
==============

Functions are a convenient way to divide your code into useful blocks
Functions are small parts of repeatable and reusable code.

A function can accept parameters, and can return values

A function in Python must have at least one instruction,
if there is no instruction, the
pass
instruction must be used, which does nothing

def do_nothing():
    pass


When a function is just defined, it will do nothing (!),
it must be called to do it's job

example:
--------


def add_numbers(number_1, number_2):
    sum_numbers = number_1 + number_2
    return sum_numbers

print(add_numbers(2, 3))
print(add_numbers(number_1=3, number_2=4))


If the function has no explicit return value,
Python will add None implicitly, so the function
will return None.
The
return
statement is used to return - give back value(s)
