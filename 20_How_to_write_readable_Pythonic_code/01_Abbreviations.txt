Do not use abbreviations
========================

Characters are free of charge,
you can use them infinite times ;-)

Abbreviations
- are hard to read
- are hard to understand
- can be ambiguous

Our brain reads words and not abbreviations


Example
-------

Bad:

ucf = UpperCaseFormatter()
ba = BankAccount()


Good:

formatter = UpperCaseFormatter()
account = BankAccount()
