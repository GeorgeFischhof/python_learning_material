# Do not use abbreviations

Characters are free of charge,<br/>
you can use them infinite times ;-)

Abbreviations  
- are hard to read  
- are hard to understand  
- can be ambiguous  

Our brain reads words and not abbreviations.

## Example

Bad:

```python
ucf = UpperCaseFormatter()
ba = BankAccount()
```

Good:

```python
formatter = UpperCaseFormatter()
account = BankAccount()
```
