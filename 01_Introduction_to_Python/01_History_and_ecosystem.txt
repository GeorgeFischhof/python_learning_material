History and ecosystem
=====================


Python
======

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)


Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.
Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991,
Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability,
notably using significant whitespace.

Scripting language, usually called very high-level because the developer's
mainly calls APIs or library module functions.

Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple
programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented,
and functional programming


Guido van Rossum (1956)
=======================

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum


Dutch developer, worked for Google, Dropbox...
He was the "Benevolent dictator for life" (BDFL) for Python until 2018

Python is not named after the snake, but Monty Python's Flying Circus,
because Guido was a big fun of the series.


Ecosystem
=========

Python is an open source language.
And because of this it has a great community. People put their ready-made
functions, libraries publicly available into Python Package Index:

https://pypi.org/

Right now the index contains more than 704 000 packages. (continuously growing)

And because it is open source the Python language itself is developed
according to needs of the users.


Python Software Foundation
==========================

https://www.python.org/psf/


The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect,
and advance the Python programming language, and to support and
facilitate the growth of a diverse and international
community of Python programmers.
