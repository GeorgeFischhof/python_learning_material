Trying something
================

You can try something in the interactive python interpreter:
start python by typing python on the command line;
>>>
cursor appears, you can write to it
You can do the same a little bit easier in the PyCharm IDE
using the Python Console window


Script execution
================

Instructions are executed from top to down, left to right in a script file
If a script file contains only function definitions, nothing will be happened. ...
The interpreter parses the functions, put them into the memory, and that is all.

A function must be called in order to execute it.
example:
--------

def some_function():
    print('apple')

some_function()


Above a function is defined with name 'some_function', and called after the definition.


The Python script has no explicit entry point.
The top-level code is executed (the most outdented)
Therefore you can define functions in any order even if they call each-other,
because they just must be defined before calling


def function_one():
    function_two()

def function_two():
    pass

function_one()


The above code will be executed in the following order:
- creating function named functions_one
- creating function named functions_two
- executing the function call for function_one
- executing function_one which calls functions_two
- executing function_two which does nothing



Execution of the script file is invoked with a command like this:
c:\> python path\to\my_script.py
