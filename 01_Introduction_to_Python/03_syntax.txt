Syntax
======


Code block
==========

A program consists of the following building blocks
- sequence (of steps)
- conditional (steps)
- loop (ing steps)

Instructions that initiate a group of other instructions (called block)
(Conditions, loops, function definitions, with statement, classes...)
are terminated with a colon :
and the block must be indented with 4 spaces
examples:

if a == 1:
    pass

for i in range(3):
    pass

def some_function():
    pass


Comments
========

Comments are started with hash mark #
examples:

# This is a commented line, this will not be executed
print('apple') # Comment starts here, apple will be printed, nothing else happens



Python is Case sensitive
========================

The keywords are all in lower case.
variables, modules, packages, classes, constants can contain upper case letters, but
case sensitivity remains:
variable1 not equals to Variable1

>>> variable1 = 42
>>> Variable1 = 'apple'
>>> print(variable1)
42
>>> print(Variable1)
apple



Indentation matters
===================

>>> for i in range(3):
>>>     print(i)
>>>     print('finished')
0
finished
1
finished
2
finished


>>> for i in range(3):
>>>     print(i)
>>> print('finished')
0
1
2
finished



One command per line
====================

There is a possibility to write more instructions in one line,
the separator is semicolon ;

But it is not readable, do not do this

And actually there are only some very rare cases,
when there is a need to write more instructions into one line



How to write "pythonic code"
============================

https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

Variables, functions: lower case, underscore between words
Classes camel case (giraffe)
Constants: all capital letters with underscores
