# History and ecosystem

## Python

**Python** is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language created by **Guido van Rossum** and first
released in **1991**. It emphasizes **code readability** through significant whitespace and is commonly described as a 
**very high-level scripting language** because developers mainly call APIs and library functions. Python is **dynamically
typed**, **garbage-collected**, and supports **procedural, object-oriented, and functional** programming paradigms.

## Origin of the name

Python is **not named after the snake**; it was named after **Monty Python’s Flying Circus**, which Guido van Rossum
enjoyed.

## Guido van Rossum

**Guido van Rossum (born 1956)** is the Dutch developer who created Python. He has worked for organizations such as **Google**
and **Dropbox**, and served as Python’s **“Benevolent dictator for life” (BDFL)** until 2018.

## Ecosystem

- **Open source**: Python is an open source language with a large community that contributes libraries and tools.
- **Python Package Index (PyPI)**: The central repository for Python packages is **PyPI** at <https://pypi.org/> The
  index contains a very large number of packages and continues to grow.
- **Community-driven development**: Because Python is open source, the language itself evolves according to user needs
  and community contributions.

## Python Software Foundation

The **Python Software Foundation (PSF)** exists to **promote, protect, and advance** the Python programming language and
to support a **diverse international community** of Python programmers. 

You can donate to the PSF and view donation
information on the official site: <https://www.python.org/psf/> and <https://www.python.org/psf/donations/>
